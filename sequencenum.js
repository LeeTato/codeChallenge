// A series or sequence of numbers is usually the product of a function and can either be infinite or finite.
// In this kata we will only consider finite series and you are required to return a code according to the type of sequence:
// CodeTypeExample0unordered[3,5,8,1,14,3]1strictly increasing[3,5,8,9,14,23]2not decreasing[3,5,8,8,14,14]3strictly decreasing[14,9,8,5,3,1]4not increasing[14,14,8,8,5,3]5constant[8,8,8,8,8,8]
// You can expect all the inputs to be non-empty and completely numerical arrays/lists - no need to validate the data; do not go for sloppy code, as rather large inputs might be tested.
// Try to achieve a good solution that runs in linear time; also, do it functionally, meaning you need to build a pure function or, in even poorer words, do NOT modify the initial input!
